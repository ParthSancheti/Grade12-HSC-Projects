Part 1 — Friendly Changelog (what I fixed & why)

SOP 1 — Index & Feedback (ashoka.html / feedback.html)

Fixed the broken link text: feedbck.html → feedback.html.

Fixed the “home” link: ashoka1.html → ashoka.html.

Removed an accidental <center> placed inside the <style> block and cleaned up extra stray <center> tags.

Normalized CSS color names: “navy blue”/“navyblue” → navy.

Kept your meta tags; didn’t inject extra boilerplate.

SOP 3 — Traveller forms

autocomplete attribute was dangling → autocomplete="on".

Fixed phone pattern: [0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4} (missing dash earlier).

Made links consistent: traveller1.html ⇄ traveller2.html (instead of assorted names).

Submit is now an image button to match the spec (“submit button as an image”).
